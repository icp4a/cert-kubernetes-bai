UBUNTU FONT LICENCE Version 1.0

-------------------------------

PREAMBLE

This licence allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and redistributed freely. The fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, and redistributed provided the terms of this licence are met. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under any other licence. The requirement for fonts to remain under this licence does not require any document created using the fonts or their derivatives to be published under this licence, as long as the primary purpose of the document is not to be a vehicle for the distribution of the fonts.  

DEFINITIONS

"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright Holder(s) under this licence and clearly marked as such. This may include source files, build scripts and documentation.  

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as received under this licence.  

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting, or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a new environment.  

"Copyright Holder(s)" refers to all individuals and companies who have a copyright ownership of the Font Software.  

"Substantially Changed" refers to Modified Versions which can be easily identified as dissimilar to the Font Software by users of the Font Software comparing the Original Version with the Modified Version.  

To "Propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification and with or without charging a redistribution fee), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.  

PERMISSION & CONDITIONS

This licence does not grant any rights under trademark law and all such rights are reserved.  

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of the Font Software, to propagate the Font Software, subject to the below conditions:  

1) Each copy of the Font Software must contain the above copyright notice and this licence. These can be included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or in the appropriate machine- readable metadata fields within text or binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.  

2) The font name complies with the following:

(a) The Original Version must retain its name, unmodified.

(b) Modified Versions which are Substantially Changed must be renamed to avoid use of the name of the Original Version or similar names entirely.

(c) Modified Versions which are not Substantially Changed must be renamed to both (i) retain the name of the Original Version and (ii) add additional naming elements to distinguish the Modified Version from the Original Version. The name of such Modified Versions must be the name of the Original Version, with "derivative X" where X represents the name of the new work, appended to that name.  

3) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) and any contributor to the Font Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any Modified Version, except (i) as required by this licence, (ii) to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or (iii) with their explicit written permission.  

4) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole, must be distributed entirely under this licence, and must not be distributed under any other licence. The requirement for fonts to remain under this licence does not affect any document created using the Font Software, except any version of the Font Software extracted from a document created using the Font Software may only be distributed under this licence.  

TERMINATION

This licence becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are not met.  

DISCLAIMER

THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF COPYRIGHT, PATENT, TRADEMARK, OR OTHER RIGHT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE FONT SOFTWARE OR FROM OTHER DEALINGS IN THE FONT SOFTWARE.

                GNU Free Documentation License
                 Version 1.3, 3 November 2008


 Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

0. PREAMBLE

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.


1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The "Document", below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.

A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of
transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats
include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
processors for output purposes only.

The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies of
the Document to the public.

A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)  To "Preserve the Title"
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.

The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.

2. VERBATIM COPYING

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no
other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.


3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to
give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
Document.


4. MODIFICATIONS

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
   unless they release you from this requirement.
C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
   Modified Version, as the publisher.
D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
   adjacent to the other copyright notices.
F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
   and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add
   to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
   there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one
   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
   Version as stated in the previous sentence.
J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
   it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
   Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
   the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
   and/or dedications given therein.
L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
   may not be included in the Modified Version.
N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements"
   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.


5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History"
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
"History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements",
and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
Entitled "Endorsements".


6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
documents released under this License, and replace the individual
copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules
of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all
other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a
copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
document.


7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.


8. TRANSLATION

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.


9. TERMINATION

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.


10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the
GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
https://www.gnu.org/licenses/.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a
version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
Document.

11. RELICENSING

"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the site
means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.

"CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit 
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco, 
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license 
published by that same organization.

"Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in 
part, as part of another Document.

An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this 
License, and if all works that were first published under this License 
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or 
in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and 
(2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.

The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.


ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

    Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
    Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
    under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
    or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
    with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
    A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
    Free Documentation License".

If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

    with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
    Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.

If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.

MongoDB, nverse_SSE.h [ITK], 
MongoDB (Copyright © 2018 MongoDB, Inc.) (https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/tree/r4.4.17)

Server Side Public License

VERSION 1, OCTOBER 16, 2018

Copyright © 2018 MongoDB, Inc.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this 
license document, but changing it is not allowed.
TERMS AND CONDITIONS
0. Definitions.

“This License” refers to Server Side Public License.

“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds 
of works, such as semiconductor masks.

“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this 
License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and 
“recipients” may be individuals or organizations.

To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the 
work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making 
of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of 
the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.

A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on 
the Program.

To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without 
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement 
under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or 
modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution 
(with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some 
countries other activities as well.

To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties 
to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer 
network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the 
extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that 
(1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that 
there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are 
provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to 
view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands 
or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

1. Source Code.

The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making 
modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of a work.

A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official standard 
defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified 
for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers 
working in that language.

The “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than the 
work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major 
Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only 
to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard 
Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code 
form. A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component 
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) 
on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or 
an object code interpreter used to run it.

The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the source 
code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object 
code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. 
However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose 
tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing 
those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding 
Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the 
work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms 
that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data 
communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the 
work.

The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate 
automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.


2. Basic Permissions.

All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright 
on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. 
This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the 
unmodified Program, subject to section 13. The output from running a covered 
work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, 
constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use 
or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

Subject to section 13, you may make, run and propagate covered works that you 
do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains 
in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of 
having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with 
facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms 
of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control 
copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so 
exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that 
prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside 
their relationship with you.

Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions 
stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.


3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under 
any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright 
treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting 
circumvention of such measures.

When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention 
of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by 
exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you 
disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means 
of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to 
forbid circumvention of technological measures.


4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, 
in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on 
each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that 
this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply 
to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give 
all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may 
offer support or warranty protection for a fee.


5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it 
from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, 
provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, 
    and giving a relevant date.
    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under 
    this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement 
    modifies the requirement in section 4 to “keep intact all notices”.
    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to 
    anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore 
    apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole 
    of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This 
    License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it 
    does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display 
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive 
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need 
    not make them do so.

A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which 
are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined 
with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or 
distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting 
copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's 
users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an 
aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.


6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 
5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under 
the terms of this License, in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a 
    physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed 
    on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.
    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a 
    physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at 
    least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer 
    support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code 
    either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product 
    that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used 
    for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of 
    physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the 
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer 
    to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally 
    and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, 
    in accord with subsection 6b.
    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or 
    for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the 
    same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require 
    recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the 
    place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may 
    be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports 
    equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the 
    object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what 
    server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is 
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform 
    other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being 
    offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.

A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the 
Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the 
object code work.

A “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any tangible 
personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, 
or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining 
whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor 
of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, “normally used” 
refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status 
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or 
expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless 
of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, 
unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.

“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods, procedures, 
authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified 
versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its 
Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued 
functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered 
with solely because modification has been made.

If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically 
for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in 
which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the 
recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is 
characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be 
accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply 
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object 
code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).

The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement 
to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has 
been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it 
has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the 
modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network 
or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.

Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord 
with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an 
implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no 
special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.


7. Additional Terms.

“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this License by 
making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that 
are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included 
in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional 
permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under 
those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without 
regard to the additional permissions.

When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional 
permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be 
written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may 
place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you 
have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered 
work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the 
terms of this License with terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections
     15 and 16 of this License; or
    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions 
    in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; 
    or
    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that 
    modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from 
    the original version; or
    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the 
    material; or
    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, 
    trademarks, or service marks; or
    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who 
    conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of 
    liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions 
    directly impose on those licensors and authors.

All other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further restrictions” within 
the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains 
a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further 
restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction 
but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work 
material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction 
does not survive such relicensing or conveying.

If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the 
relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a 
notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.

Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately 
written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.


8. Termination.

You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this 
License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically 
terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the 
third paragraph of section 11).

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular 
copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder 
explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright 
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days 
after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if 
the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is 
the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) 
from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your 
receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties 
who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been 
terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for 
the same material under section 10.


9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the 
Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of 
using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. 
However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any 
covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. 
Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of 
this License to do so.


10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license 
from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this 
License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this 
License.

An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or 
substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging 
organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, 
each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever 
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the 
previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work 
from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with 
reasonable efforts.

You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or 
affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, 
or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not 
initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging 
that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or 
importing the Program or any portion of it.


11. Patents.

A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the 
Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called 
the contributor's “contributor version”.

A contributor's “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or controlled 
by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be 
infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling 
its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only 
as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes 
of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a 
manner consistent with the requirements of this License.

Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license 
under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, 
import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.

In the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express agreement or 
commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission 
to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To “grant” such a 
patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a 
patent against the party.

If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding 
Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms 
of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, 
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to 
deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, 
in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to 
downstream recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge that, but for the 
patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the 
covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country 
that you have reason to believe are valid.

If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or 
propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of 
the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a 
specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended 
to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.

A patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, 
prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights 
that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are 
a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, 
under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying 
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the 
covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the 
covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in 
connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you 
entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or 
other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.


12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict 
the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you 
cannot use, propagate or convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations 
under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not use, 
propagate or convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a 
royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could 
satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.


13. Offering the Program as a Service.

If you make the functionality of the Program or a modified version available to third parties 
as a service, you must make the Service Source Code available via network download to everyone 
at no charge, under the terms of this License. Making the functionality of the Program or 
modified version available to third parties as a service includes, without limitation, enabling 
third parties to interact with the functionality of the Program or modified version remotely 
through a computer network, offering a service the value of which entirely or primarily derives 
from the value of the Program or modified version, or offering a service that accomplishes for 
users the primary purpose of the Program or modified version.

“Service Source Code” means the Corresponding Source for the Program or the modified version, and 
the Corresponding Source for all programs that you use to make the Program or modified version 
available as a service, including, without limitation, management software, user interfaces, 
application program interfaces, automation software, monitoring software, backup software, 
storage software and hosting software, all such that a user could run an instance of the service 
using the Service Source Code you make available.


14. Revised Versions of this License.

MongoDB, Inc. may publish revised and/or new versions of the Server Side Public License from 
time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ 
in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain 
numbered version of the Server Side Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have 
the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later 
version published by MongoDB, Inc. If the Program does not specify a version number of the Server 
Side Public License, you may choose any version ever published by MongoDB, Inc.

If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the Server Side Public 
License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes 
you to choose that version for the Program.

Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional 
obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow 
a later version.


15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN 
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM 
“AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED 
TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE 
RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE 
DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.


16. Limitation of Liability.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT 
HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE 
LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES A
RISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA 
OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE 
PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED 
OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.


17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local 
legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely 
approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a 
warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.
